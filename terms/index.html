            <p><strong>Last updated: February 11, 2025</strong></p>

            <h2>1. AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you,"
                or "your") and Airmass Sustainables (Private) Limited ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), governing your
                access to and use of the Airmass Xpress mobile application ("App") and related services ("Services").
            </p>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree
                with any part of these Terms, you must not use the App.</p>

            <h2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</h2>

            </ul>
            <p>The App allows Clients to post tasks, receive competitive bids from Service Providers, and hire
                professionals. Airmass Xpress acts solely as an intermediary platform and is not a party to any
                agreement between Clients and Service Providers.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time if you violate these Terms, engage
                in fraudulent activity, or behave in a manner harmful to other users or the platform.</p>

            <h2>5. POSTING TASKS AND BIDDING</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Task Posting</h3>
            <p>Clients may post tasks describing the work they need completed. Task descriptions must be accurate,
                lawful, and not misleading. Tasks must relate to legitimate services within the construction and built
                environment sectors.</p>
            <h3>5.2 Bidding</h3>
            <p>Service Providers may submit bids on posted tasks. Bids constitute an offer to perform the described work
                at the stated price. Clients are free to accept, reject, or negotiate any bid.</p>
            <h3>5.3 Acceptance</h3>
            <p>Once a Client accepts a bid, both parties enter into a direct contractual relationship. Airmass Xpress is
                not a party to this contract and bears no liability for the performance, quality, or outcome of the
                work.</p>

            <h2>6. PAYMENTS</h2>
            <h3>6.1 Payment Processing</h3>

            <h3>6.2 Fees</h3>
            <p>Airmass Xpress may charge service fees or commissions on transactions conducted through the platform. Any

            <h3>6.3 Disputes</h3>
            <p>Payment disputes between Clients and Service Providers should be resolved directly between the parties.
                Airmass Xpress may, at its discretion, assist in mediating disputes but is under no obligation to do so.
            </p>
